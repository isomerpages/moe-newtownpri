A Leader in Every Child
-----------------------

  

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in student leadership is one of the schoolâ€™s key platforms to provide our students with varied and meaningful learning experiences. The school has adopted the Leader in Me Framework in 2020 to develop our young student leaders. The evidence-based framework, originally developed by Dr. Stephen Covey, will explicitly teach our students the 7 Habits to empower them with the leadership and life skills they need to thrive in the 21st Century.
