Choir

The voice is a child’s first instrument and it is the most primitive medium used to express human emotions. These young and vibrant singers learn to use their voices with the right techniques and read scores whilst being exposed to a wide range of repertoire, ranging from classical to jazz to popular songs. They develop confidence, self-discipline and are passionate performers. A choir member can look forward to performing regularly both in school and in public, serving the community by performing to the elderly yearly and participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.
