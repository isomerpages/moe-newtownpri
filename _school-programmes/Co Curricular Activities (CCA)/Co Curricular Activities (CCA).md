CCA is an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.  

  

At New Town Primary School, every Primary 3 to Primary 6 student takes part in one CCA taken from the following options:

*   [Clubs & Societies](https://newtownpri-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/school-programmes/co-curricular-activities-cca/clubs-n-societies)
*   [Performing Arts](https://newtownpri-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/school-programmes/co-curricular-activities-cca/performing-arts)
*   [Physical Sports](https://newtownpri-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/school-programmes/co-curricular-activities-cca/physical-sports)
*   [Uniformed Group](https://newtownpri-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/school-programmes/co-curricular-activities-cca/uniformed-group)
