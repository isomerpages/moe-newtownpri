**7 Habits Leader in Me**

We believe that it can never be too early to develop all New Towners as student leaders. The school adopts the “Leader in Me” Framework, developed by Dr. Stephen Covey, to empower our students with leadership and life skills through explicit teaching of the 7 Habits.

Watch this video to find out how our student leaders apply these habits in their daily lives.
