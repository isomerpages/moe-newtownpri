<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Welcome to the school’s website! Thank you for taking time to visit and
find out more about the school. New Town Primary School was established
in July 1965 and has a rich history of educating and inspiring students
to grow and learn through their years in primary school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here at New Town Primary, we aim to grow and nurture our students into
Passionate Learners, Critical Thinkers and Anchored Leaders through our
range of learning experiences both within and beyond the classroom, and
under the guidance of the school’s nurturing and committed staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Embracing learning is the first component of being a <strong>Passionate Learner</strong>.
Learning dispositions and positive habits are nurtured in our students
to help them adopt a learning stance of curiosity and courage. Not all
learning is easy and there will be moments of struggle but we seek to develop
a joy and a passion for learning that will set our students up for success,
both now and in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the joy of learning, we also develop our students as <strong>Critical Thinkers</strong> who
are able and willing to challenge themselves to go further. The theme for
2025 is <em>Level Up: Accept the Challenge –</em> and it is this spirit of
self-improvement and the courage to push past one’s limits to grow that
makes one a Critical Thinker. This is what we want all our students to
be! Within the school’s total curriculum, there are many opportunities
for students to accept and overcome challenges, develop a sense of self-efficacy
and find their identity and purpose to grow and constantly challenge themselves.
This could be through student leadership, cohort camps, overseas immersion
trips – the list goes on!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, learning and growth is not focused only on the self. Here at
New Town Primary school, we want our students to learn and grow, so that
they can serve and lead others. In doing so, they will make a difference
wherever they go and whatever they choose to do. This is the <strong>Anchored Leader </strong>that
we want all our New Town Primary students to become. In small and big ways,
the school provides opportunities for students to serve each other, serve
the community and take the initiative to contribute to causes beyond themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a school, we are always pursuing excellence and innovating to find
more purposeful ways of achieving our school’s vision. In line with this,
we have been upgrading the school’s facilities and learning environment
such as the building of the new Teaching Block 4, the refurbishment of
Art Rooms, Teaching Labs and other key spaces allow our students to learn
in a vibrant and conducive environment.</p>
<p>As we continue to innovate, grow and pursue excellence as a school, we
invite you to join and partner us in this exciting journey of learning!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
<br>Ms Hannah Chia
<br>Principal, New Town Primary School</p>
