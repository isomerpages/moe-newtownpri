<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>What a joy it is to welcome you to our New Town Primary School community!
I'm so glad you've taken the time to learn more about our wonderful school.</p>
<p>Since our doors first opened in July 1965, New Town Primary has been more
than just a place of learning – it's been a home where many children have
discovered their potential, formed lasting friendships, and grown into
confident young people ready to take on the world.</p>
<p>Every day, I watch our students light up as they discover something new,
tackle a challenge they thought was impossible, or help a friend in need.
This is what drives everything we do here. We're committed to nurturing
each child to become a <strong>Passionate Learner </strong>who loves discovering
new things, a <strong>Critical Thinker</strong> who isn't afraid to ask "what
if?" and "why not?", and an <strong>Anchored Leader</strong> –someone who
genuinely cares about making a positive difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p>Learning isn't always easy – and that's perfectly fine! Some of our most
meaningful growth happens when we're stretching ourselves beyond our comfort
zones. Our dedicated teachers are right there alongside each student, celebrating
the small victories and providing gentle encouragement when things get
tough. We want every child to experience that wonderful "aha!" moment and
develop a genuine love for learning that will serve them throughout their
lives.</p>
<p>I'm thrilled to share that our theme for 2026 is <strong>'Power Up: Be a Changemaker'</strong> –
and it feels like a natural next step from last year's 'Level Up: Accept
the Challenge.' You know how wonderful it is to watch our students embrace
difficult tasks and push through when things get tough? Well, now we're
ready to take that courage and channel it into something even more exciting!
Whether it's an older senior school mate who befriends and supports a younger
school mate in his adjustment to school or CCA or a classmate who helps
his friend who's struggling with Maths, or our student leaders whose innovative
projects help to build a positive school environment, we want every student
to realise they don't have to wait for someone else to create change.</p>
<p>The magic happens when children discover they're not just passengers in
their own learning journey – they're the drivers! During our level programmes,
I love seeing that spark in a child's eyes when they realise their idea
actually worked, or their encouragement helped a classmate succeed. Our
classrooms become laboratories for problem-solving, and our beyond-classroom
learning journeys open their minds to possibilities. What excites me most
is that we're nurturing a generation who won't just adapt to the world
they inherit – they'll actively shape it into something better.</p>
<p>What makes me particularly proud is seeing how our students look out for
one another and seek to help their community. From small acts of kindness
in the classroom to larger service projects, they're learning that true
leadership means service and lifting others up.</p>
<p>We're constantly looking for ways to make learning even more engaging
and meaningful. You'll notice we've been refreshing our spaces – our Teaching
Lab, Student Services Hub and Computer Lab have had makeovers, and we're
always finding new ways to create an environment where learning feels exciting
and natural.</p>
<p>I'd love for you to be part of our New Town Primary family. Together,
we can help your child discover just how amazing they can be.</p>
