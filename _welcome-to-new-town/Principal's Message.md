A warm welcome to a new academic year!

2022 was an exciting year for the school. The school has put up a commendable performance in the 2022 Primary School Leaving Examination and has provided varied learning experiences for the students in both the curriculum and co-curriculum areas. Despite having to weather many unexpected challenges brought forth by the pandemic over the past 3 years, the school is heartened to see our students, staff and parents displaying resilience, grit, personal and social responsibility during this difficult period. With the relaxation of the nation-wide Safe Management Measures in 2022, we are happy to see the return of full student activities in the various learning domains of learning, including the return of learning journeys, National Schools Games, Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and other physical activities like outdoor adventure camps.Â 

Moving into our next new school chapter and embracing new opportunities and challenges faced along the way, the school strives to continue with our quest to nurture our students holistically through the provision of a vibrant school experience for all; one that envisions for all New Towners to be empowered and future-ready individuals who will shine in various domains of learning.

To all New Towners, I would like to challenge you to pursue learning with curiosity and passion while staying rooted in values. As you dive into your classes and explore knowledge in the various learning school experiences, I encourage you to think critically and ask questions that will deepen your understanding of the world around you. In doing so, you will be well-equipped to solve problems, apply learning to different situations, make meaningful contributions and lead fulfilling lives.

To all New Town educators and staff, I look forward to serving alongside you to deliver a holistic, engaging and empowering school experience for our students, and in building a community of lifelong learners who are committed to make a positive difference to those around them.

To all New Town parents, alumni, partners and friends, thank you for your unwavering support over the years. I look forward to deepening our ties and partnerships with you to bring the school to its next milestone of growth.

Rise with us as one New Town Community!
