Welcome to a new academic year!

  

2021 has continued to be a challenging year with the on-going Covid-19 situation. Despite having to weather many unexpected challenges when managing the issues revolving around the pandemic, the school is heartened to see our students, parents and staff rallying together and displaying resilience, grit, personal and social responsibility during this difficult period.  Continuing with the 2021 Prize-Giving Day theme, the 2022 school theme, ‘WE RISE’ has been chosen to reflect how we have as one New Town Family overcome and risen above the many challenges faced along the way and reach for the horizon and seek new breakthroughs. ‘We RISE’ is also a reminder to all New Towners to celebrate their unique gifts and talents and to use them make a difference in the lives of others; and in the midst, realize our school values of _Resilience_, _Integrity_, _Service_ and _Excellence_.

  

To ensure that the school remains future-ready in the strive for teaching and learning excellence, the school has embarked on the redesigning and upgrading of the various spaces in the school, including the canteen, library, school hall, various special rooms as well as refreshing our campus with the setting up of art exhibition areas in the teaching block. The school has also started its two-year on-site PERI Upgrading since December 2019. Following the projected completion of the upgrading in mid-2022, delayed for about 6 months due to the on-going pandemic, our teachers and students will enjoy new and enhanced school facilities which will include a new school field, special rooms like CCA rooms, band room, dance studio, staff resource rooms, teaching lab and Student Care Centre; serving the needs of the various co-curricular activities in the school, and supporting our students in their pursuit and nurturing of interests and talents in the various domains of learning like Sports, Aesthetics, Learning for Life Programme and Applied Learning Programme.

  

Moving into our next new school milestone, the school strives to continue with our quest to nurture our students holistically through the provision of a vibrant school experience for all; one that envisions all New Towners to be empowered and future-ready individuals who learn with passion, think with a critical mind, and lead with a sense of purpose.

  

New Town prides itself in providing vibrant and meaningful learning experiences for our students in the various domains. We are guided by the belief that every child has unique gifts, strengths, interests and passion; and the belief that every student has the potential and is able to learn and flourish if given the space and opportunity to shine. Aligned to the national Skillsfuture Movement, and considering that ‘Active Learning and Learning Strategies’ is projected to be one of the top 10 skills of 2025 reported under the World Economic Forum ‘The Future of Jobs Report 2020’, New Town has drawn up 4 learning dispositions we aspire to nurture in all our students. Encapsulated under the acronym ‘READ; through the collective and skillful efforts of our teachers in designing our daily teaching and learning experiences, we aspire for all New Towners to embrace an attitude of lifelong and independent learning through developing them to become **Responsible** learners with an **Enquiring** mind; and **Active** contributors with a **Determined** spirit. We look forward to partnering our parents in this quest for the New Town READ learning dispositions to be nurtured in all our children. 

  

As a school, New Town continues to rise above the challenges faced along the way to scale new heights. Our teachers remained undaunted and navigated many unknowns to embrace new modes of teaching and learning through bold experimentation of different technologies and adoption of blended learning to ensure that all curriculum and co-curriculum activities and programmes are able to carry on effectively and safely. In the academic area, New Town has continued to put up a credible performance across the different academic subjects at the 2021 PSLE. Numerous awards were clinched by the students in the various national competitions held in 2021 for the different subject disciplines, including commendable achievements in the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition for English Language, the Annual Mathlympics, the Singapore and Asian Schools Maths Olympiad and the National Math Olympiad for Mathematics of Singapore. Our students have also done the school proud by emerging as overall champion in the 2021 Liverable Cities Challenge organsied by Raflles Institution and achieving numerous awards in the Singapore Primary Science Olympiad of Singapore.

New Town is also committed to deepen our students’ learning experiences in the various co-curricular activities through the myriad of opportunities provided in the form of e-CCAs, competitions and other learning opportunities. The school is a proud recipient of the certificate of recognition at the Category C of the Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition 2021 and the Red Cross Youth Director’s Award. To extend the learning of students beyond their CCAs, our teachers designed E-CCA modules for the P3 to P6 students during the weekly CCA periods, providing them with different learning experiences from the various CCA groups – in the areas of physical sports, performing arts, uniformed groups and clubs & societies. The E-CCA modules provided a new and innovative to the way CCA lessons are traditionally conducted in New Town. Up to 30 E-CCA modules have been designed and conducted for the students in 2021, testimony of our determination to trial and experiment new ways of teaching and learning in the face of challenges. 

  

Our school’s [Learning for Life Programme](https://moe-newtownpri-staging.netlify.app/school-programmes/learning-for-life-programme-llp) is in the area of Student Leadership. Anchored by the school values, this distinctive programme aims to develop in our students the necessary life skills and attitudes that will prepare them to be well-poised to meet current and future challenges. The school has adopted the “The Leader in Me – 7 Habits of Highly Effective Students” for our student leadership development. The principles in the 7 Habits equip students with personal and team leadership skills. 

  

The school’s Applied Learning Programme, [Citizen scieNcE@New Town](https://moe-newtownpri-staging.netlify.app/school-programmes/applied-learning-programme-alp) is an interdisciplinary programme with Science and Social Studies to empower our students to play their part as active contributors in their community. The ALP aims to heighten the students’ awareness of the role of Science in addressing issues of national interest, such as on energy, food and water security. 

  

This is an African saying, ‘Ubuntu’ which means ‘I am because we are’. This saying by Desmond Tutu speaks about the essence of community; that we are all connected in one way or another and what we do affects the whole world. Thus, when we do well, it spreads out to the rest of the community and the whole of humanity. I can fully resonate with this saying. This belief in the sense of community is also boldly stated in our school strategic thrust that goes ‘The New Town Community – Supporter, Partner and Collaborator’. The achievements we have attained and the overcoming of the many challenges in the various domains of learning would not have been possible if not for the commitment, hard work and personal sacrifices of all staff members and partners of New Town Primary. I would like to take this opportunity to thank and affirm all staff for your dedication and your tireless efforts in leading, caring and inspiring the students under your care. Thank you for your belief and commitment in guiding your students through the different learning experiences and your display of teamwork along the way. 

  

The many uplifting New Town stories, many of them speaking of our celebration of successes and rising above the odds would not have been possible without the unwavering support and partnership of our key stakeholders like the SAC, PSG, our parent volunteers and community partners. 

  

The school deeply appreciates the personal sacrifices and commitment you have given to the school over the years. To our School Advisory Committee, thank you for the valuable advice, insights and support given to the school. To our Parent Support Group, thank you for your close walk and unwavering support in providing a safe and meaningful school experience for our children.  To all our community partners and friends, thank you for your strong friendship. The school is immensely grateful to all of you in making possible the many school events and programmes, aimed at providing our students with a holistic education and a safe and happy school environment. Thank you for being a supporter, partner and collaborator to New Town.

  

As we move into 2022, I look forward to strengthening ties with all staff, parents and stakeholders to steer New Town to its next milestone of growth. With your support and belief, we aspire to scale new heights; and in building a strong sense of school pride, rootedness and belonging for all. 

  

Quoting from Jane Goodall, ‘There is a powerful force unleashed when young people resolve to make a change’. To all New Towners, we all hold the key to change -- change to uplift those around us, our families, our community and the whole of humankind. Choose to unleash what us within you to make that difference, one person, one day at a time. Uplift one another, and as one New Town Community, WE RISE.

  

Wishing all an uplifting 2022!
