**<font size=6>School Safety</font>**

In New Town Primary, our students’ safety is the highest priority and we do not want to wait for an accident to happen before doing anything. Your cooperation will make a huge impact on the safety of pupils. Let’s make New Town Primary a safer place for all.

**<font size=5>Drop Off Point</font>**

Every morning, many parents stop along Tanglin Halt to drop their children off for school. This causes congestion along the road and oftentimes, pupils who are using the pedestrian crossing have to negotiate their way between cars to cross the road. In view of the danger it poses to our students, the school would like to appeal, to all parents who drive, to use the car park opposite the school to drop your children off.

**<font size=5>Emergency Drills</font>**


*   Emergency evacuation drills are held at regular intervals throughout the school year. An emergency evacuation map is posted in each classroom and teachers discuss the emergency route and plan with the pupils at the start and the middle of the school year.

  
**<font size=5>Field Trips / Learning Journeys / Competitions / Events</font>**

*   Field trips, Learning journeys and competitions enhance or supplement the curriculum and are scheduled throughout the school year as part of the school day wherever possible. In some cases a fee may be charged to cover admission costs. The school issues letters to parents in advance to notify them when such trips are planned. If for some reason you object to your child participating in these programmes, please notify your child’s teacher.

  
**<font size=5>Security & Safety in the School Premises</font>**

*   The school would like to appeal to all parents not to remain in the school except when necessary. Parents whose children require special attention are to obtain permission from the school.
*   When within the school campus, all parents / visitors must wear the special passes issued by the security guards. This will enable us to quickly identify unauthorised persons within the school premises. Teaching blocks are out of bounds to all visitors .
