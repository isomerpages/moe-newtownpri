<h2>Physical Sports</h2>
<p>Building on the Physical Education (PE) programme to create a strong foundation
for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities
for recreational participation, Physical Sports CCAs cater to students
with interest in both recreational and competitive levels. Physical Sports
CCAs develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students as they
become active and physically competent individuals in the sports that they
participate in.</p>
