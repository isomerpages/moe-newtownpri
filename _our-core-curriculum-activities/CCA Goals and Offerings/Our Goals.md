<h4>CCA Goals</h4>
<p>CCA is an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA,
students discover their interests and talents while developing values and
competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>CCA promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they
learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration
and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility
to school, community and nation.</p>
<p>Leadership opportunities within all CCA sessions allow our students to
hone their leadership skills to become competent and confident future leaders
of the country.</p>
<p>At New Town Primary School, every P3 to P6 student takes part in one CCA
from one of the following categories:</p>
<p>* [Clubs and Societies](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/clubs-and-societies/)</p>
<p>* [Performing Arts](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/performing-arts/)</p>
<p>* [Physical Sports](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/physical-sports/)</p>
<p>* [Uniformed Groups](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/)</p>
