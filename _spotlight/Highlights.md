**Family Rojak Making Session**

As part of our Racial Harmony Day Commemoration, our New Town Cheerleaders organised a Family Rojak Making Session and shared about the importance of racial and religious harmony in Singapore with our international students and their families.
It was certainly a fun and meaningful session to bond with one another!

**The Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence**

Our former student, Lee Keng Xian, was awarded The Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence at the MOE Special Awards Presentation Ceremony held on 29 August 2022!

Keng Xian graduated in 2021. He was an active learner and band member who strove for Excellence and he also demonstrated the school value of Service with a Heart through his many contributions as a student leader.

On this Teachers' Day, Keng Xian returned to his alma mater to visit and show his appreciation to his teachers and school leaders.

The New Town Family would like to congratulate Keng Xian for his astounding achievement. May he continue to shine and inspire others to fly the New Town flag high!
