**Family Rojak Making Session**

As part of our Racial Harmony Day Commemoration, our New Town Cheerleaders organised a Family Rojak Making Session and shared about the importance of racial and religious harmony in Singapore with our international students and their families.
It was certainly a fun and meaningful session to bond with one another!
