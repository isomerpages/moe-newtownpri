<h4><strong><em>Tiered Student Leadership Development</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The school’s 3-tiered leadership development programme is designed to
cater to the interests, talents and aptitudes of all New Towners. By helping
our students to discover and develop their unique strengths, interests
and competencies through customised leadership platforms and opportunities
for meaningful learning experiences, they will be able to make a positive
difference at home, in school and the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>Tier 1: Equipping our Student Leaders</em>
</p>
<p>Anchored on the school’s values RISE, the focus at Tier 1 is to equip
New Towners with the leadership paradigms of effective student leadership.
During their level programmes such as the level camps, students engage
in activities that encourage resilience, teamwork, responsible decision-making,
and the building of positive relationships with peers and teachers. These
experiences provide an authentic platform for students to grow in confidence,
practise respectful communication, and strengthen the bonds that support
their leadership journey in the classroom and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
