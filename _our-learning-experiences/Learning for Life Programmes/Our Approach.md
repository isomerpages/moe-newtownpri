<h4><strong><em>Tiered Student Leadership Development</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The school’s 3-tiered leadership development programme is designed to
cater to the interests, talents and aptitudes of all New Towners. By helping
our students to discover and develop their unique strengths, interests
and competencies through customised leadership platforms and opportunities
for meaningful learning experiences, they will be able to make a positive
difference at home, in school and the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Tier 1: Equipping our Student Leaders</em>
</p>
<p>Anchored on the school’s values RISE, the focus at Tier 1 is to equip
New Towners with the leadership paradigms of effective student leadership.
During their level programmes such as the level camps, students engage
in activities that encourage resilience, teamwork, responsible decision-making,
and the building of positive relationships with peers and teachers. These
experiences provide an authentic platform for students to grow in confidence,
practise respectful communication, and strengthen the bonds that support
their leadership journey in the classroom and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Tier 2: Empowering our Student</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Tier 2, our New Towners are empowered to apply and practise their leadership
skills through authentic platforms. As part of level-wide and cross-level
activities, students step forward to take on greater leadership responsibilities,
building confidence and autonomy. Through these experiences, they are enabled
to put into practice what they have learnt, strengthening their readiness
to serve in meaningful ways across the school community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To equip our Prefects, Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) and CCA Leaders with
the skills and leadership competencies to develop them in their leadership
roles, they attend various training workshops on peer support, public speaking
and project management.</p>
