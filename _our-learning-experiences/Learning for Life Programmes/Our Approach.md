<h4><strong><em>Tiered Student Leadership Development</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The school’s 3-tiered leadership development programme is designed to
cater to the interests, talents and aptitudes of all New Towners. By helping
our students to discover and develop their unique strengths, interests
and competencies through customised leadership platforms and opportunities
for meaningful learning experiences, they will be able to make a positive
difference at home, in school and the community.&nbsp;</p>
