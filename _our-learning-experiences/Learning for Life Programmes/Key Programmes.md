<h4><strong><em>Emerging Student Leadership Programme</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Emerging Student Leadership Programme provides opportunities for student
leader nominees to discover and grow their leadership potential through
authentic experiences. Beginning with identification and nomination by
teachers, our Prefect and PSL nominees embark on team-based activities
such as the Leadership Quest, where they build teamwork, communication,
and critical thinking skills while reflecting on the qualities of effective
leaders. This is followed by the Leadership Shadow Programme, where nominees
observe, support, and practise leadership responsibilities in real school
settings. Through these experiences, student leader nominees gain confidence,
resilience, and the readiness to take on formal leadership roles such as
Prefects and Peer Support Leaders.&nbsp;</p>
