<h4><strong><em>A Leader in Every Child</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in student leadership is one of
the school’s key platforms to provide our students with varied and meaningful
learning experiences. The school has adopted the Leader in Me Framework
in 2020 to develop our New Towners into anchored leaders who serve the
school and community. The evidence-based framework, originally developed
by Dr. Stephen Covey, explicitly teaches our students the 7 Habits to empower
them with the leadership and life skills they need to thrive in the 21st
Century.&nbsp;</p>
