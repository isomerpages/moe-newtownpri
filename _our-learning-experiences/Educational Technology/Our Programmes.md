<p><u>Lower Primary&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Primary 1 and 2, we focus on using technology to mediate engaging learning
experiences in the classroom. Students also go through a simple coding
programme that builds their computational thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Middle Primary</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Primary 3 and 4, students use devices more frequently to learn both
independently and collaboratively. They engage in collaborative tasks using
Google Suite tools and other online platforms, and learn to co-create knowledge
and artefacts online and communicate effectively in shared digital spaces.
They also pick up online research skills, including responsible information
search and basic data analysis. To ensure meaningful experiences, the students
are guided to use devices safely and responsibly through classroom physical
and digital routines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Upper Primary</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Primary 5 and 6, students use devices regularly in their learning and
interactions with others in online spaces increase. As such, students explore
digital responsibility by understanding internet etiquette, online identity,
and respectful participation in online communities. They learn to communicate
with consideration, respect copyright and intellectual property, and practise
good social media etiquette. Students deepen their technological skills
in collaborative learning, content creation and communication, and problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
