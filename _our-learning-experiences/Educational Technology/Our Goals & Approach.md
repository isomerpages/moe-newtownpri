<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At New Town primary, we seek to develop our students to be digitally-empowered
and future-ready, who are able to use technology effectively to learn,
collaborate and innovate.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>In alignment with the <strong>EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong> and the <strong>emerging 21st Century Competencies (e21CC)</strong> framework,
we weave technology and e-Pedagogy into our teaching to create an environment
that encourages active and collaborative learning, and facilitates student
acquisition of e21CC, which includes digital literacy and technological
skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our EdTech lessons are designed with the <strong>Key Applications of Technology (KATs)</strong> in
mind, guided by the <strong>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold</strong>, featuring
the use of SLS and various EdTech tools to develop thinking and collaboration
skills, which are key to building curious, motivated and empathetic learners.&nbsp;</p>
