<p>The ALP is integrated into the curriculum across all levels, ensuring
a progressive and comprehensive learning experience. Students in the lower
primary levels (Primary 1-3) are introduced to the foundational concepts
of cognitive flexibility through engaging and age-appropriate activities.
They learn to observe their surroundings, identify simple problems, and
brainstorm creative solutions through play and hands-on projects. These
initial experiences build their curiosity and empathy, which are crucial
starting points for problem-solving.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>As students progress to the upper primary levels (Primary 4-6), the ALP
deepens with more complex and authentic challenges. They will participate
in projects that require them to apply cognitive flexibility to discuss
real-world issues, either within the school or the wider community. These
projects can involve collaboration with external partners, giving students
the opportunity to impact an authentic audience.&nbsp;</p>
