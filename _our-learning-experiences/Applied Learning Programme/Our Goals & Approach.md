<h4><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Cultivating Cognitive Flexibility</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><em>The New Town ALP is currently undergoing review and will be refreshed for 2016. Read about our refreshed ALP below.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To develop cognitive flexibility, specifically in critical and adaptive
thinking, in our students to enable them to solve complex problems&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of our ALP is to build a strong foundation in our students for
lifelong learning, preparing them to thrive in a future where change is
constant. By the end of their primary school journey, we envision our students
to be able to confidently approach novel situations and contribute meaningfully
to their communities. They will have developed the confidence to explore
different perspectives, the resilience to persevere in the face of setbacks,
and the collaborative skills to work effectively with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ALP is structured around processes in Design Thinking. Students learn
at different stages to empathise with others, define challenges and problems,
brainstorm and evaluate ideas together, and reflect on their implemented
solutions. This experiential and applied process encourages them to develop
diverse perspectives and embrace ambiguity, and to master skills in un-learning
and re-learning.&nbsp;</p>
