**School Crest**

![](/images/About%20Us/Crest%20only%20(coloured%20no%20background).png)

The lion represents Singapore, where we as citizens continually serve.

The flame in front of the lion signifies the philosophy of the school in inculcating sound moral values.

The open book stands for knowledge and spirit of learning.


**Motto**

**Ready to Serve**

We must always uphold sound moral values and keep alive the spirit of learning in order to be ready to serve our country.



**School Song and Lyrics:**

In New Town Primary, where we start

Together we step forth with our hearts

We’re caring, we’re honest and we stand high

The values, we uphold and unify  


**Chorus:**  Sing New Town Primary School forever

We are ready to serve together

The loyalty we have will be forever

Happy in every new endeavour  


Time to time and as we walk hand in hand

Forging our friendship till the end

Minds and hearts within the years we can

Sing with pride, as one we stand  


Yes! We are from New Town Primary School

Caring and always respectful

Be honest, be loyal that’s what we care

Do our best for success all that we share  


**Chorus:**  Sing New Town Primary School forever

We are ready to serve together

The loyalty we have will be forever

Happy in every new endeavour
