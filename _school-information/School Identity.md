### School Crest

<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/About%20Us/Crest%20only%20(coloured%20no%20background).png">

The lion represents Singapore, where we as citizens continually serve.

The flame in front of the lion signifies the philosophy of the school in inculcating sound moral values.

The open book stands for knowledge and spirit of learning.


### Motto

**Ready to Serve**

We must always uphold sound moral values and keep alive the spirit of learning in order to be ready to serve our country.

In New Town Primary, where we start<br>
Together we step forth with our hearts<br>
We’re caring, we’re honest and we stand high<br>
The values, we uphold and unify  <br>

**Chorus:**  Sing New Town Primary School forever<br>
We are ready to serve together<br>
The loyalty we have will be forever<br>
Happy in every new endeavour  <br>

Time to time and as we walk hand in hand<br>
Forging our friendship till the end<br>
Minds and hearts within the years we can<br>
Sing with pride, as one we stand  <br>

Yes! We are from New Town Primary School<br>
Caring and always respectful<br>
Be honest, be loyal that’s what we care<br>
Do our best for success all that we share  <br>

**Chorus:**  Sing New Town Primary School forever<br>
We are ready to serve together<br>
The loyalty we have will be forever<br>

Happy in every new endeavour
