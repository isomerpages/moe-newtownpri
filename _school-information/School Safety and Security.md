**Drop Off and Drive-In Policy**

  

Drop off outside the school along Tanglin Halt road is strictly not allowed. This causes congestion along the road and poses a danger to our students. Parents/Guardians should use the car park opposite the school to drop your child/ward off .

In the event of wet weather, the security guards will allow parents to drive into the school in the morning to drop your children off, and half an hour after school dismissal hours to pick up your children. This is to allow time for the school buses to leave the school compound.

When within the school campus, all parents / visitors must wear the special passes issued by the security guards. This will enable the school personnel to quickly identify unauthorised persons within the school premises. Classrooms, children’s play areas and the canteen are out of bounds to all visitors except parent volunteers on duty.

Students who take the public transport to school are encouraged to use the following identified safe walking routes as shown in the map below.

For safety and security reasons and to minimise disruption during lessons, parents/guardians are not allowed to enter the teaching blocks at all times.

No parents/guardians, relatives or any members of the public are allowed to remain in the school at all times without prior approval from the school.

Unless authorised, visitors are not allowed to park their vehicles in the school compound.
