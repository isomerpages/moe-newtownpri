<p><strong>School Safety and Security</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ARRIVAL AND DISMISSAL</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents should not alight their children outside the school gate near
the pedestrian crossing to avoid traffic congestion along Tanglin Halt
Road.<strong> </strong>This also poses a danger to students using the pedestrian
crossing from cars negotiating around your parked cars.</p>
