<p>Our Reading Circles give high-progress learners the chance to enjoy literature
more deeply. Through guided discussions, they explore interesting stories,
notice how good writers use language, and reflect on the values and themes
within the texts. This not only sharpens their language skills but also
nurtures a love for reading and thoughtful conversations.&nbsp;</p>
