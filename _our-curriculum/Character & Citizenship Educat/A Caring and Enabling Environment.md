<h3><strong>A Caring and Enabling Environment</strong></h3>
<p>At New Town, we strive for a caring and enabling school environment that
is inclusive and safe. We believe that our students thrive when they experience
positive emotions in their school experience.</p>
<p><strong>Start It Right</strong>
</p>
<p>Our teachers set the tone for building positive relationships with our
Start It Right programme from the very first week of school. The programme
begins with class bonding activities and games for students to get to know
their Form Teachers, as well as their new classmates.</p>

<p><strong>Class Mission Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>Creating a class mission statement is one of the ways our teachers encourage
student voices in creating a positive class culture. Students share their
thoughts and ideas about the physical and emotional classroom environment
that would support their learning and growing together.</p>

<p><strong>Morning Connect</strong>
</p>
<p>Form teachers focus on building trusting relationships that help our students
feel connected during Morning Connect, through one-to-one conversations
with students, to find out more about them as unique individuals and build
a deeper connection.</p>
