<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>Physical Education (PE) in New Town Primary School emphasises movement.
Movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. Movement
competency facilitates participation in physical activities and allows
individuals to derive pleasure and satisfaction from them. PE, therefore,
builds students’ capacity to make responsible and informed choices towards
sustaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>New Towners learn fundamental movement skills which incorporate movement
concepts. They develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their
performance as they practice and transfer skills across the seven learning
areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education,
Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become Competent, Confident
and Values-Driven Movers.</p>
