<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The <strong>Singapore Curriculum Philosophy</strong> and <strong>Singapore Teaching Practice</strong> shape
learning, teaching, and assessment in Physical Education (PE). PE adopts
an <strong>applied learning approach</strong>, helping students connect
skills and concepts to authentic contexts, while fostering values and social-emotional
competencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key lesson design considerations include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience</strong> – provide authentic opportunities to practise
skills.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> – encourage co-construction of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong> – develop critical thinking and reflection.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration</strong> – connect content across topics for transferability.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differentiation</strong> – cater to diverse learning needs.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong> is integral, informing progress and engaging
students in self-reflection. PE teachers, guided by the syllabus’ big ideas
and purpose, implement a balanced school-based curriculum that supports
students in achieving the goals of Physical Education.&nbsp;</p>
