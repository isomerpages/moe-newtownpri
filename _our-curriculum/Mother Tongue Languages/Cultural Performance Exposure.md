<p>The Cultural Performance Exposure programme provides students with valuable
opportunities to experience the richness of performances related to their
Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Through these performances, students gain
a deeper understanding of their MTL as a living language, enriching their
learning beyond the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
