<p>This programme is designed to create an immersive and engaging environment
for students to learn and use their Mother Tongue Language meaningfully.
Held over two consecutive weeks, the Mother Tongue Language Fortnight features
a wide range of activities that allow students from Primary 1 to 6 to actively
experience the language and culture in authentic ways. For Primary 3 students,
the Language &amp; Cultural Camp offers hands-on experiences such as traditional
dance, ceremonies, and traditional arts. Through these activities, students
gain a deeper appreciation of Chinese culture and experience the language
as a ‘living language’ that connects them to their heritage and identity.&nbsp;</p>
