<p>This programme aims to strengthen students’ reading skills and foster
a love for the Mother Tongue Language (MTL). The programme provides scaffolded
reading sessions where students read in small groups under the guidance
of their teachers.&nbsp; By using age-appropriate and culturally relevant
reading materials, the programme not only builds reading fluency and comprehension
but also nurtures students’ interest in the language and culture.&nbsp;</p>
