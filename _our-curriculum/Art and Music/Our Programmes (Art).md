<h4>Music Maestros and Music Makers&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Music Maestros is a platform that provides New Town musicians with valuable
performance opportunities, allowing them to showcase their talents on stage
for their schoolmates. This initiative helps young musicians build confidence,
gain stage experience, and share their musical abilities with their peers
in a supportive school environment. It creates meaningful connections between
student performers and audiences whilst celebrating musical talent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Music Makers focuses on hands-on creativity through DIY instrument-making
activities. Participants learn to construct their own musical instruments,
exploring the relationship between materials and design. This approach
makes music accessible to all students regardless of prior musical training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
