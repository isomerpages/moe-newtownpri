<p>New Town Artist is an internal visual art drawing competition that provides
a platform for students to showcase their artistic talents in a supportive
environment. This initiative fosters healthy competition whilst celebrating
artistic excellence and creativity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The competition encourages students to refine their drawing skills, build
confidence in presenting their artwork, and learn from their peers' diverse
artistic interpretations and styles. It recognises and rewards dedication
to art whilst inspiring other students to pursue their own creative journeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
