<p>The P3 Ukulele Programme introduces Primary 3 students to music-making
through using the ukulele. Students learn fundamental skills including
simple chords and chord progressions, enabling them to play popular contemporary
songs such as 'Just the Way You Are' and 'Best Day of My Life'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme makes music education enjoyable and achievable for our
Primary 3 students, building their confidence as they master recognisable
tunes. Through hands-on practice with the ukulele, students develop musical
literacy, rhythm, and coordination whilst experiencing the satisfaction
of playing complete songs. The choice of popular music helps maintain student
engagement and motivation, making the learning process both fun and rewarding.
By the end of the programme, students gain foundational musical skills
and a genuine appreciation for music-making.</p>
