<p>Music Maestros is a platform that provides New Town musicians with valuable
performance opportunities, allowing them to showcase their talents on stage
for their schoolmates. This initiative helps young musicians build confidence,
gain stage experience, and share their musical abilities with their peers
in a supportive school environment. It creates meaningful connections between
student performers and audiences whilst celebrating musical talent.&nbsp;</p>
