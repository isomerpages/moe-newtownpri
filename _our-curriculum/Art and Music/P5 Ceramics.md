<p>The P5 Ceramics Programme introduces students to ceramics through comprehensive
hands-on learning. Students explore ceramics history, distinguishing functional
and non-functional pieces whilst mastering the complete process from design
through building, drying, bisque firing, glazing, and glaze firing. They
develop technical proficiency in techniques including pinching, coiling,
and scoring and slipping, whilst applying textures using lines, shapes,
and tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the programme, students create their ceramic sculptures
representing personal emotions or experiences, demonstrating understanding
of each process stage and correct glazing techniques whilst fostering creative
expression.&nbsp;</p>
