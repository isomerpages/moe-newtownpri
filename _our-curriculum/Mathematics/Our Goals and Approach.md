### Our Goals

Building a strong foundation in mathematical concepts and skills and developing thinking, reasoning, communication and application through a mathematical approach to problem solving

### Our Approach

##### **Inquiry-based Learning in Mathematics**

Inquiry-based learning in Mathematics is the development and attainment of Mathematics concepts and skills with a problem situation using an inquiry-oriented approach. Teachers lead and guide students to explore, investigate and sense-make on their own so that they can build new ideas and knowledge.

Being regularly immersed in an inquiry-based environment, students become naturally confident in Mathematics. They learn to connect with the resources and participate in the learning process actively. Students who are encouraged to ask questions and challenge ideas are more likely to contribute towards classroom discussions with their peers, thereby boosting their confidence further. Confidence is a disposition that lasts a lifetime and students who enjoy inquiry-based learning are more likely to become thoughtful and motivated life-long learners.

##### **E-pedagogy in the Learning of Mathematics**
At our school, we believe that every child can enjoy and succeed in mathematics when learning is made meaningful, engaging, and accessible. Through the use of e-pedagogy, we harness technology to bring abstract concepts to life and create interactive learning experiences for our pupils. Platforms such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) provide guided practice and visualisations that help pupils build strong understanding of key concepts. Blooket introduces fun and excitement by turning problem-solving into games, while ClassPoint and Snorkl enables teachers to check understanding instantly and provide immediate support during lessons. These tools also allow pupils to learn at their own pace, revisit topics when needed, and receive timely feedback to strengthen their confidence. By blending technology with effective teaching practices, we nurture curiosity, resilience, and a love for mathematics that will support our pupils in their learning journey.
