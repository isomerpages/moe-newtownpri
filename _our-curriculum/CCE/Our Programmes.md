<p><strong>Values in Action @ New Town</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who
contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application
of values, knowledge and skills. As part of their VIA projects, students
reflect on their experience, the values they have demonstrated, and how
they can continue to contribute meaningfully at home, in school and in
the community.&nbsp;</p>
