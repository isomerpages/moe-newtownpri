of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving
the lives&nbsp;</p>
<p>of others, and building a future for our nation.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We believe that values and life skills are best nurtured through <strong>explicit teaching</strong>, <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>,
and <strong>meaningful application</strong> in our students’ daily lives.
To help students internalise values, build social-emotional competencies,
and develop strong citizenship dispositions, we provide them with multiple
learning platforms. These include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CCE lessons</strong>, where key concepts and skills are taught
directly,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Development Experiences</strong>, which allow students
to apply what they learn in authentic settings, and&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>School-based initiatives</strong>, which create opportunities
for students to live out the values in their school community.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
