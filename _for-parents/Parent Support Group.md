Our Parent Support Group, PSG@New Town, has always been our key partner in education. Parents play a huge role in being the support and role models for our New Towners.

Our PSG is the voice representing the parents of New Town across various platforms. 

Our PSG aims to :
* Enhance the vibrancy of school environment by co-creating programmes for the students
* Have an active and collaborative partnership with all members of the school community
