Our Mission is to render our services and provide support to the school in its various programmes and activities to our best abilities. We will tap on the expertise of our parent volunteers to achieve active collaborative partnership among parents, teachers and the community.  

If you are a parent / guardian of a child in New Town Primary School, we hope that our dynamism in actively promoting the above goal would encourage you to be an active parent in supporting the school in its various programs and activities.

For more information, you can refer to ourÂ [PSG website](http://psgntps.wix.com/psg-ntps).

To join us, please download the form and submit it to the school's General Office. Thank you.
