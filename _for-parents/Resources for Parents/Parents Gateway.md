Introducing Parents Gateway
---------------------------

  

Parents Gateway is a digital service that connects parents / legal guardians and schools on key administrative matters. 

Parent's Gateway is available as a mobile app on [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moe.pgp&hl=en_SG) or [Apple store](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/parents-gateway/id1267198708?mt=8). With the app, you will receive school letters, announcements and consent forms more conveniently and giving consent for your child's school activities is as easy as a tap on your mobile screen.
