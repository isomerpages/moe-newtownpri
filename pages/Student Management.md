**<font size=5>Programmes</font>** <br>
We believe that learning takes place in caring and safe environments. We cultivate positive teacher-student and peer relationships so that there is a culture of care and mutual respect in our classrooms, where children learn to appreciate diversity.

**P1 to P6**  <br>
