**Assembly Programme (P1 to P6)**

Collaborating with the National Arts Council and other arts agencies, New Towners gain insights into different art forms such as Dance, Music, Art and Theatre. During the SMM restrictions, we have continued to bridge professional artists and art groups to share with New Towners via online platforms and are glad to be able to bring them back into our school for Assembly Programmes.
