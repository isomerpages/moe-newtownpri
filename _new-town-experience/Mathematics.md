**Vision**

A confident and effective problem solver in Mathematics

**Goals**

Building a strong foundation in mathematical concepts and skills and developing thinking, reasoning, communication and application through a mathematical approach to problem solving

**Learning Support Mathematics (LSM) (P1 to P4)**
This programme aims to provide early intervention support in Mathematics to students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills. In small groups, LSM trained teachers help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age and equip them with the mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions through learning experiences.

**Inquiry-based Learning in Mathematics**

This programme emphasises on the development and attainment of Mathematics concepts and skills with a problem situation using an inquiry-oriented approach. Teachers lead and guide students to explore, investigate and sense-make on their own so that they can build new ideas and knowledge.

Being regularly immersed in an inquiry-based environment, students become naturally confident in Mathematics. They learn to connect with the resources and participate in the learning process actively. Students who are encouraged to ask questions and challenge ideas are more likely to contribute towards classroom discussions with their peers, thereby boosting their confidence further. Confidence is a disposition that lasts a lifetime and students who enjoy inquiry-based learning are more likely to become thoughtful and motivated life-long learners.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics (P4 to P5)**

The E2K Mathematics Programme is an enrichment for selected P4 and P5 students. It aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme. Through the rich learning experiences offered by the programme, students will develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess. They will also gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.

**Math Olympiad Training and Competitions**

Math Olympiad Training is an enrichment for P3 to P6 students. This programme aims to stretch students who are talented and passionate about Mathematics. Students learn and apply concepts acquired to real life experiences. They will be more confident in applying the concepts and skills learnt to solve challenging Mathematics sums involving higher-order thinking. They also participate in selected competitions and Math Olympiads to gain exposure beyond the school and encourage them to value intellectual pursuits.
