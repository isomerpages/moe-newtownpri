In line with MOE’s Science Curriculum Framework, our goal is to provide students with a strong foundation in Science for life, learning, citizenry, and work.

1.  Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives.

2.  Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.
