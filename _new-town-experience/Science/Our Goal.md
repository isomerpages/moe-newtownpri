**Our Goal**

In line with MOE’s Science Curriculum Framework, our goal is to provide students with a strong foundation in Science for life, learning, citizenry, and work.

1.  Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives.

2.  Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

**Our Approach **

The New Town Science curriculum is represented by the three “IN”s – Inspire, Inquire and Innovate. 

a. Inspired by Science - Students enjoy learning Science as they see how everyday phenomena have scientific connections which make Science relevant and meaningful. 

b. Inquire like Scientists - Students are equipped with the scientific concepts and skills necessary to allow them to engage in Practices of Science to conduct scientific inquiry. 

c. Innovate using Science - Students are able to apply Science to address real-world problems in school and at home.
