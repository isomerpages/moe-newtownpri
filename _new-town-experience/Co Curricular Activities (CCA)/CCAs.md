## CCA Goals ##

CCA is an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. 

CCA promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation. 

Leadership opportunities within all CCA sessions allow our students to hone their leadership skills to become competent and confident future leaders of the country. 

At New Town Primary School, every P3 to P6 student takes part in one CCA from one of the following categories:
* [Clubs and Societies](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/clubs-and-societies/)
* [Performing Arts](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/performing-arts/)
* [Physical Sports](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/physical-sports/)
* [Uniformed Groups](/new-town-experience/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/)
