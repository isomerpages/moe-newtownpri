<h3>Choir</h3>
<p>The voice is a child’s first instrument and it is the most primitive medium
used to express human emotions. Our young and vibrant choir members learn
to use this “first instrument” with the right techniques while being exposed
to a wide repertoire of songs, ranging from classical, jazz to contemporary
songs. They develop good confidence, self-discipline and better proficiency
in singing, which are necessary to become passionate and competent performers.
Members can look forward to performing regularly both in school, external
performances and participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation.</p>
