<h2>Uniformed Groups</h2>
<p>Uniformed Group CCAs aim to make good citizens of students by providing
authentic learning experiences which will help them develop important qualities
such as self-reliance, leadership, resilience, discipline, teamwork and
a spirit of service to others.</p>
<p>We offer the following Uniformed Groups CCAs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Girl Guides (Brownies)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red Cross (Youth)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Girl Guides (Brownies)</strong></h3>
<p>Brownies are part of the Guiding movement where our girls develop their
fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. We provide interesting
and engaging activities where our Brownies acquire knowledge and skills
through games and play. They learn different skills such as tying knots,
painting, baking, singing and dancing as part of their CCA sessions. To
further hone their service leadership skills, our Brownies are trained
to provide yeoman service for various school and community events such
as for Open House and Sports Day.</p>

<h3><strong>Red Cross (Youth)</strong></h3>
<p>Red Cross (Youth) aims to build a community of young leaders who are achievers,
socially responsible and embrace humanitarian values. Values such as compassion
and empathy are emphasised through various CCA sessions. Our members are
equipped with the necessary first aid knowledge such as dressing simple
wounds and tying arm slings. They are also provided with opportunities
to apply their knowledge such as providing first-aid support during school
events such as Sports Day. Our members are also given opportunities to
demonstrate their proficiency in various competitions such as the Red Cross
National First Aid Competition.</p>
