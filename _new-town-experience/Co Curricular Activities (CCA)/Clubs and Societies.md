<h2>Clubs and Societies</h2>
<p>Clubs &amp; Societies CCAs allow students to explore and extend their
interests in both wide-ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based
or skills-based. Students are honed in information, communication and technical
skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas.</p>
<p>We offer the following Clubs &amp; Societies CCAs:</p>

<h3><strong>Art &amp; Crafts</strong></h3>
<p>The Art &amp; Crafts club caters to students who are passionate about
visual art and crafts and want to pursue their interests to deepen their
knowledge, skills and understanding of Art. Members have the opportunity
to use different mediums and work with both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional
art forms. They interact and collaborate with like-minded peers and teachers-in-charge
to expand their creativity, ideas and thoughts. Members can take part in
the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Exhibition, a national
platform to communicate, showcase and benchmark their creativity and ideas.</p>
