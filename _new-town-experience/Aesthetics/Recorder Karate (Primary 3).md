**Recorder Karate (Primary 3)**

Recorder Karate motivates students to achieve their musical goals, gives them a sense of achievement and builds their confidence in their first year of learning to play the recorder. It gamifies learning with differentiated tasks and promotes collaboration amongst students with an online concert hall created by their performance submissions.
