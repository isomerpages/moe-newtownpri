**Other Platforms**

Students who demonstrate strong interest and abilities in art and music are recommended to participate in arts-related events in the public domain. Mentored by art and music teachers during the preparation process, students are given opportunities to engage in activities that demand more rigour and skills at a higher level. Some of these events are, the PassionARts Festival art competition, Chingay50 Music in Harmony, the Lion Clubs International Peace Poster Competition and the KAO International Environment Painting Contest for Children.
