**Vision**

A community of creative and resilient learners that expresses positive ideas and has an informed appreciation for the arts. 


**Goals**

Cultivating in students an appreciation and participation in the arts, through learning experiences that educate, nurture and empower. 


**Music**

The Music syllabus aims to enable students to:

*   Acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through Listening, Creating and Performing  
*   Develop abilities for creative expression and communication
*   Develop an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global cultures  
*   Cultivate a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music

In New Town, students learn music by experiencing musical concepts before they learn and apply it. Using a blend of Orff and Kodaly approaches, students listen, create and perform music to develop musical creativity and critical thinking skills through collaboration and decision-making opportunities.

**Art**

The Art syllabus aims to enable students to:

*  Enjoy art  
*  Communicate visually
*  Make meaning through connecting with society and culture


Students learn art by going through the 5 processes, ‘Connect & Wonder’, ‘Reflect’, ‘Express’, ‘Make’ and ‘Investigate’ in the Art Inquiry Model. This non-linear inquiry-based strategy nurtures curiosity and creativity. Moving between the spectrum teacher-directed and student-directed learning, it empowers students to own their creative process giving them a voice and choice.
