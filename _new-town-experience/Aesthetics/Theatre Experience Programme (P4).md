**Theatre Experience Programme (P4)**

Theatre is one of the oldest forms of entertainment. No two shows are ever exactly the same. When students participate as an audience in the same space, they become part of the performance and this authentic experience puts them directly into the action that theater creates. As New Towners reflect on the themes and perspectives presented in the performance, they are presented with opportunities to develop empathy, compassion and creativity to resolve the challenges presented in the story.
 
This programme had been conducted online due to Covid-19 SMM restrictions and resumed in 2022. It provides students with an opportunity to attend and appreciate a professional production in a purpose-built space, pique their interest in theatre, and cultivate an informed and lifelong involvement with the performing art form.
