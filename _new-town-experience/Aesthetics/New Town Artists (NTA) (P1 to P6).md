**New Town Artists (NTA) (P1 to P6)**

Inaugurated in 2021, New Town Artistsâ€™ is designed as a school-based art competition with the  intent of challenging students in their creativity and artistic skills. This is open to all students who wish to gain experience to prepare themselves for external art competitions while building their personal portfolio.
 
Conducted twice a year, students present their thoughts and ideas by creating original art, in response to a theme with set parameters for each edition of the art competition.
 
Through this programme, we hope to encourage students to take initiative and ownership for their learning while building confidence in themselves for the future.
