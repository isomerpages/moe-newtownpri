**Theatre Experience (Primary 4)**

Theatre is one of the oldest forms of entertainment. No two shows are ever the same. When students participate as an audience in the same space, they become part of the performance. This authentic experience puts them directly into the action that theater creates. 

As New Towners reflect on the themes and perspectives presented in the performance, they are presented with opportunities to develop empathy, compassion, and creativity to resolve the challenges presented in the story.
