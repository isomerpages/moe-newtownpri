**Camp Endeavour (P5)**

Camp Endeavour aims to equip our P5 students with important life skills that will enable them to perform proficiently in curricular and co-curricular activities. Camp Endeavour allows our students to forge stronger relationships with classmates and teachers through collaboration to achieve set goals. Through outdoor adventure activities, our students develop outdoor education skills and build values such as resilience and facing challenges with positivity. They demonstrate responsible decision making towards themselves and their teammates. Key to studentsâ€™ learning is the reflection session at the end of each activity and the entire programme. During the reflection sessions, teachers facilitate a consolidation of the learning outcomes and a discussion on how students can apply the skills and values gained in life situations.
