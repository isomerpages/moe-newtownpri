**Vision**

Competent, Confident and Values-Driven Movers

**Mission**

To nurture and develop all New Towners into all-round physically educated individuals to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living

**Department Goals**

* To facilitate our students in achieving the following outcomes:
* Acquire a range of motor skills to participate in a variety of physical activities
* Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities
* Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment
* Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences
* Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities
* Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life

Physical Education (PE) in New Town Primary School emphasises movement. Movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. Movement competency facilitates participation in physical activities and allows individuals to derive pleasure and satisfaction from them. PE, therefore,  builds studentsâ€™ capacity to make responsible and informed choices towards sustaining a healthy lifestyle. 

New Towners learn fundamental movement skills which incorporate movement concepts. They develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practice and transfer skills across the seven learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become Competent, Confident and Values-Driven Movers.
