**Our Goals**

*   To provide opportunities that allow students to engage in active listening, reading and viewing to enrich the language learning experience. 
    

*   To provide experiences that allow students to communicate effectively through speaking, writing and representing to promote confidence in using the English language. 
    

**Our Approach** 

At New Town Primary, we follow the MOE English Language Syllabus 2020. The aim is to help every child build a strong foundation in English, enjoy the language, and use it confidently in everyday life. 

What this means for your child: 

*   Strong basics first – In the early years, we focus on reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. Phonics, vocabulary and grammar are taught in meaningful ways. 
    

*   Step-by-step growth – Teachers provide guidance at the start and gradually encourage children to take more responsibility for their own learning. 
    

*   Learning with purpose – English is taught through real-life tasks, stories, conversations and digital media so children see the relevance of what they learn. 
    

*   Reading for life – We nurture a love for reading, giving students time and opportunities to read widely for both learning and enjoyment. 
    

*   All-round skills – Beyond reading and writing, children also learn to speak clearly, listen actively, and use English in different forms such as visuals, videos and presentations. 
    

*   Confidence and creativity – Students are encouraged to share their ideas, think critically, and express themselves in different ways. 
    

*   Support for every learner – Lessons are tailored to meet different learning needs, ensuring each child is supported to progress at their own pace. 
    
**Our Programmes **

**STELLAR (P1 to P6) **

The STELLAR vision: Children who love reading and have a strong foundation in the English Language. 

**STELLAR** aims to strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational years. The programme uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage children in the learning of English. At lower primary, language skills are developed through Shared Book Approach, modified Learning Experiential activity and Focused Differentiated lessons. As students progress to upper primary, language skills are further developed through KWL, Supported Reading and Writing Process Cycle.

**Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) (P1 to P4) **

The learning of English is most effective when it takes place through **authentic and meaningful experiences.** During our **Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE)**, students step out of the classroom and engage in hands-on activities that bring language learning to life. These real-world contexts provide rich opportunities for them to practise targeted language skills in fun and purposeful ways.

**Extended Reading Programme **

At New Town Primary, we believe that reading should be both meaningful and fun. Our **Extended Reading Programme** gives students many opportunities to explore the joy of books beyond the classroom. Every alternate Tuesday, students enjoy **Story Tuesday** before the flag-raising ceremony, Our library is also alive with engaging **reading activities** that encourage students to explore different genres. Our lower primary learners (P1–P3) dive into digital stories through **Raz Kids Plus**, and our upper primary students (P4–P6) sharpen their awareness of the world around them with the **Little Red Dot** newspaper. A highlight of the year is our **Reading Week**, where the entire school celebrates with a full week of activities — from book quizzes and storytelling to dressing up as favourite book characters. Together, these experiences nurture a love for reading and inspire our students to become lifelong learners.

**Writing Programme (P1 to P6) **

Students at New Town Primary learn to create a wide variety of texts to communicate meaning clearly and effectively. They write **procedural texts** such as recipes and instructions, craft **letters for different audiences**, and develop **narratives** to express ideas and stories. They also learn to design** visual texts**, such as digital posters, to communicate messages creatively. To nurture creativity and confidence, we encourage **freewriting** activities like journals and quick writes, giving students the freedom to use English spontaneously and with enjoyment.

**Reading Circles (P4 to P5)** 

Our Reading Circles give high-progress learners the chance to enjoy literature more deeply. Through guided discussions, they explore interesting stories, notice how good writers use language, and reflect on the values and themes within the texts. This not only sharpens their language skills but also nurtures a love for reading and thoughtful conversations.
