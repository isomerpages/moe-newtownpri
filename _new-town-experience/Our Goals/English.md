**Our Programmes **

**STELLAR (P1 to P6) **

The STELLAR vision: Children who love reading and have a strong foundation in the English Language. 

**STELLAR** aims to strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational years. The programme uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage children in the learning of English. At lower primary, language skills are developed through Shared Book Approach, modified Learning Experiential activity and Focused Differentiated lessons. As students progress to upper primary, language skills are further developed through KWL, Supported Reading and Writing Process Cycle.

**Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) (P1 to P4) **

The learning of English is most effective when it takes place through **authentic and meaningful experiences.** During our **Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE)**, students step out of the classroom and engage in hands-on activities that bring language learning to life. These real-world contexts provide rich opportunities for them to practise targeted language skills in fun and purposeful ways.

**Extended Reading Programme **

At New Town Primary, we believe that reading should be both meaningful and fun. Our **Extended Reading Programme** gives students many opportunities to explore the joy of books beyond the classroom. Every alternate Tuesday, students enjoy **Story Tuesday** before the flag-raising ceremony, Our library is also alive with engaging **reading activities** that encourage students to explore different genres. Our lower primary learners (P1–P3) dive into digital stories through **Raz Kids Plus**, and our upper primary students (P4–P6) sharpen their awareness of the world around them with the **Little Red Dot** newspaper. A highlight of the year is our **Reading Week**, where the entire school celebrates with a full week of activities — from book quizzes and storytelling to dressing up as favourite book characters. Together, these experiences nurture a love for reading and inspire our students to become lifelong learners.

**Writing Programme (P1 to P6) **

Students at New Town Primary learn to create a wide variety of texts to communicate meaning clearly and effectively. They write **procedural texts** such as recipes and instructions, craft **letters for different audiences**, and develop **narratives** to express ideas and stories. They also learn to design **visual texts**, such as digital posters, to communicate messages creatively. To nurture creativity and confidence, we encourage **freewriting** activities like journals and quick writes, giving students the freedom to use English spontaneously and with enjoyment.

**Reading Circles (P4 to P5)**

Our Reading Circles give high-progress learners the chance to enjoy literature more deeply. Through guided discussions, they explore interesting stories, notice how good writers use language, and reflect on the values and themes within the texts. This not only sharpens their language skills but also nurtures a love for reading and thoughtful conversations.

This is an MOE intervention programme led by specially trained teachers to support selected P1 and P2 students. Conducted in small groups of up to 10, lessons run for half an hour each day and focus on strengthening students’ English language skills in a supportive and encouraging environment. 

**kidsREAD (P1 to P2)**

In collaboration with the National Library Board (NLB), the programme nurtures a love for reading in our P1 and P2 students, helping them discover the joy of stories from an early age.
