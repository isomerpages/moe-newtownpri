**Let’s Read Program for Interactive Speaking Skills (Lower Primary)**

This reading program leverages the ‘Mari Membaca’ reading resource as a proficiency program to enhance the students’ reading and interactive speaking skills in Malay Language. The resources have been adapted and customised for richer learning, to build their vocabulary, sentence mastery and overall confidence in speaking the language. Activities include reading in pairs or groups, reflections, as well as peer-to-peer feedback sessions.


**Differentiated Instruction (DI) Reading Program (Lower Primary)**

This reading program leverages the ‘Saya Boleh Membaca’ reading resource as a modified approach to spark the students' passion for reading Malay Language materials. The resources have been adapted and customied to engage the students in guided buddy reading to build their vocabulary and overall confidence in speaking the language. There are various manipulatives to help them along and this can all be done at the classroom’s dedicated reading corner “Sudut Membaca” too!


**Enhancing Listening and Speaking Skills through Experiential Learning (P2)**

P2 students are immersed in fun and engaging lessons based on the theme of tradition and culture taken from the syllabus. The lessons serve as a platform for students to increase their proficiency of conversing effectively in Malay as well as to further develop their interactive speaking skills – in preparation for Higher Mother Tongue in the following year. In addition, students are given the opportunity to model active listening skills, such as focusing and processing information during lessons. Students demonstrate active learning during structured interactions and group activities through Cooperative Learning (CL) and Making Thinking Visible (MTV) Thinking Routines with their peers. They also acquire new vocabulary and grammar skills, along with prescribed sentence structures through songs, quizzes and group discussions.


**Malay Language Fortnight (P1 to P6)**

Following this year’s theme of “Rootedness in Arts and Discovering the Beauty in our MT languages”, the New Town Malay Language team aims to create a fun and immersive learning environment to promote speaking in Malay. Authentic opportunities are provided for the students to use and express the language "as a living language" so that they can become active and proficient users of Malay Language.


**Malay Language Fortnight Cultural Camp Experience**

In the Jawi Calligraphy experience, students are introduced to the traditional Malay calligraphy script with different letters and strokes and produce their own hand-written greeting in Jawi.
 In the Wayang Kulit Puppet-making Workshop, students learn about the brief history of wayang kulit in Malay culture. They then make and decorate their own Wayang Kulit puppet.
