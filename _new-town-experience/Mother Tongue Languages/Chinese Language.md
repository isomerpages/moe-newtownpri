The department aims to make the learning of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) a joy, and seek to nurture a love in the learning of Mother Tongue Languages and its underlying culture.
We provide authentic settings aimed at creating an immersive environment for the acquisition of Mother Tongue languages through a variety of activities related to Mother Tongue cultures. These platforms provide authentic opportunities for students to apply their Mother Tongue languages and experience the culture.

**Chinese Language Fortnight (P1 to P6)**

To create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL, two consecutive weeks have been designated as MTL Fortnight, during which a wide range of activities related to the Mother Tongue language and culture will be conducted. The purpose of the MTL Fortnight is to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture so as to experience MTL as ‘living languages’.

**Guided Reading Programme (P1 to P6)**

To cultivate in students a love of reading and lay down the foundation for the acquisition of Chinese Language, students are exposed to a compilation of in-house created picture books, audio-visual books and exemplary essay pieces..


**Cultural Performance Exposure (P2)**

Students visit Chinese Language cultural performances and programmes by local and foreign bodies . Students view world-class performances while acquiring Chinese language and cultural knowledge.


**Conversational Malay for Chinese Students (CCM) (Selected P3 & P4 students)**

A school-based Conversational MTL enrichment programme for interested students seeks to equip students with basic oral skills of their non-MTL and allow them to communicate with their friends and neighbours of different races. This initiative aims to  bridge the language divide and strengthen racial harmony. 

**Chinese Language Cultural Camp (P4)**

Primary 4 students participate in a Cultural Camp and engage in a wide variety of activities related to Chinese language and culture, such as Chinese Painting and Chinese Calligraphy. Parents are invited to join their child for these activities.
