The department aims to make the learning of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) a joy, and seek to nurture a love in the learning of Mother Tongue Languages and its underlying culture.
We provide authentic settings aimed at creating an immersive environment for the acquisition of Mother Tongue languages through a variety of activities related to Mother Tongue cultures. These platforms provide authentic opportunities for students to apply their Mother Tongue languages and experience the culture.

**Chinese Language Fortnight (P1 to P6)**

To create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL, two consecutive weeks have been designated as MTL Fortnight, during which a wide range of activities related to the Mother Tongue language and culture will be conducted. The purpose of the MTL Fortnight is to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture so as to experience MTL as ‘living languages’.
