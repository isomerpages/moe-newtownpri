<li>
<p>Our Mother Tongue Department is committed to a <strong>learning-centered</strong> approach
to nurture confident and culturally rooted learners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>We embrace <strong>differentiated instruction (DI) </strong>to cater to
the diverse needs and learning paces of our students, ensuring that each
child can progress meaningfully in their language journey.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Harnessing ICT</strong>, we create engaging and interactive learning
experiences that promote customized, self-directed, and collaborative learning.
Through the use of digital tools and platforms, students are empowered
to take ownership of their language development in ways that suit their
individual styles.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>To deepen critical thinking and reflection, we integrate <strong>thinking routines</strong> into
our lessons. These routines encourage students to connect ideas, explore
perspectives, and build a stronger understanding of language and culture.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these approaches foster a vibrant learning environment where
students develop proficiency and a lifelong love for their Mother Tongue.&nbsp;</p>
