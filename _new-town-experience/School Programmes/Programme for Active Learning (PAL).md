**PAL Goals**  

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is offered to P1 and P2 pupils. It comprises modules in four areas, namely:  

*   Outdoor Education 
    
*   Performing Arts 
    
*   Sports & Games
    
*   Visual Arts 

PAL activities provide the opportunities for the development of dispositions such as having a lively curiosity about the world they live in, the ability to cooperate with others and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge, through experimentation, exploration, interaction with peers and opportunities to achieve success.
