**Applied Learning Programme - Citizen scieNcE@New Town**

Our Applied Learning Programme is an interdisciplinary programme that explores the National Education (NE) Issues of food, energy and water security through the lens of Science, innovation and technology.

**Goals**

![](/images/ALPGoals.jpeg)

Singapore, a nation with limited natural resources, continually faces the challenges of vulnerability in terms of sufficient and stable food, energy and water supply. As a country, we have mitigated these challenges through innovation and technology, and thrived in the past few decades. Our ALP seeks to sensitise our students to these issues and equip them to appreciate, act on and eventually advocate for these issues.

P2 students are&nbsp; exposed to the concepts of water, food and energy security through hands-on activities. Through the activities, students appreciate that our access to clean water, safe and nutritious food, and reliable energy should not be taken for granted.

From P3 to P6, students deepen their learning about food, water and energy security in an inquiry-based approach through four phases: Experience, Investigate, Create and Showcase. Authentic experiences in the ALP allow our students to connect what they have learnt in Science to make sense of NE issues. They then apply critical thinking and communication skills to advocate for these NE-related causes.
