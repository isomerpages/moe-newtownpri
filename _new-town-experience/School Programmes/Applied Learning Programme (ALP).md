Our Applied Learning Programme seeks to empower our students to play their part as active contributors in their community in addressing National Education (NE) issues through the lens of Science. Named “Citizen scieNcE@New Town”, the ALP is an interdisciplinary learning of Science and NE that aims to heighten students’ sensitivity to the role of Science in securing Singapore’s future in addressing NE issues on energy, food and water security.

  

As a nation with limited natural resources, our survival depends on our ability to stay open and remain connected to the global networks of trade, energy, food and water supply, and innovate to mitigate these constraints. The ALP offers students the opportunity to examine NE issues through the lens of Science, exposing them to a wide variety of authentic learning experiences that weave in the understanding of Science into the NE discourse. The interdisciplinary nature of the programmes will also enable the students to generate new insights, and devise everyday solutions or be advocates for action, thereby playing their part as active citizens in addressing the national issues. The programme is also aligned to our belief in student empowerment, as encapsulated in our school’s vision - “_Passionate Learners. Critical Thinkers. Anchored Leaders_.”

  

  
**<font size=5>3‘A’s@NewTown – A Three-Tier Approach TO ALP</font>**  

The New Town ALP experience is structured into three tiers - Appreciate, Act and Advocate - to provide different depths and rigour of learning experiences for students. This “**3‘A’s@NewTown**” model allows the school to progressively scaffold students’ acquisition of knowledge and skills through authentic learning experiences, and deepen their application of learning as they progress through each tier.
