#### **LLP Goals and Framework**

*A Leader in Every Child*

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in student leadership is one of the school’s key platforms to provide our students with varied and meaningful learning experiences. The school has adopted the Leader in Me Framework in 2020 to develop our New Towners into anchored leaders who serve the school and community. The evidence-based framework, originally developed by Dr. Stephen Covey, explicitly teaches our students the 7 Habits to empower them with the leadership and life skills they need to thrive in the 21st Century.

**Tier 1: Equipping our Student Leaders**

The school’s 3-tiered leadership development programme is designed to cater to the interests, talents and aptitudes of all New Towners. By helping our students to discover and develop their unique strengths, interests and competencies through customised leadership platforms and opportunities for meaningful learning experiences, they will be able to make a positive difference at home, in school and the community.

Anchored on the school’s values RISE, the focus at Tier 1 is to equip New Towners with the leadership paradigms of effective student leadership, As part of the school’s Start-it-Right programme in Term 1, students work with their Form Teachers to co-create the physical and emotional environment of a leadership classroom. They also create a Class Mission Statement for the class to work together effectively for the year.

**Tier 2: Enriching our Student Leaders**

Our students embark on the LLP’s signature programme – The Leader in Me at Primary 4 and Primary 5. Through class discussions and hands-on activities, they learn to apply the 7 Habits in their Values-in-Action \[VIA\] projects and be active contributors in the school and community.

To equip our Prefects and CCA Leaders with the skills and leadership competencies to develop them in their leadership roles, they attend various training workshops on peer support, public speaking, and Habit 8 Find Your Voice. At school events, our student leaders host and organise activities, and play the important role of school ambassadors to share with visitors about our exciting New Town family experience. They also lead in student-initiated projects to raise awareness about community issues close to their hearts, and rally their peers to play an active role in making a positive impact on New Town and the community.

**Tier 3: Empowering our Student Leaders**

The Prefect EXCO members play the important role of leading their peers in their respective committees/CCAs, and mentoring their junior leaders. They also work closely together, under the guidance of the LLP teachers, to also lead in student-initiated projects to raise awareness about community issues close to their hearts, and rally their peers to play an active role in making a positive impact on New Town and the community.
