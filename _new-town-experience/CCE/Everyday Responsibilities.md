To inculcate in New Towners a sense of responsibility and care for shared spaces within the school, students are involved in helping one another in the daily cleaning of the school environment.

It aims to empower them in serving from school to their homes and communities as Active Contributors in whatever way they can, developing A Sense of Belonging to Singapore. 

Our Everyday Responsibilities programme includes:

1.	Daily Classroom Duties 

Every New Towner will be given a role to play in the class to contribute to the daily cleaning of the classroom.

2.	5-minutes Cleaning Up (before dismissal)

Before dismissal, every New Towner gets into action in cleaning up their spaces used.

3.	Inter-Class Cleanliness Inspection (I.C.C.I.) 

In each class, 2 Environment Monitors are appointed. They conduct an inspection in an assigned class every Thursday morning and award points for cleanliness. They snap photographs and write words of affirmation for the good efforts made by their peers in keeping their learning spaces clean, which are shared monthly at morning assembly. 

4.	Spotless Checks and Sparkling Classroom Awards

Classes are awarded stars fortnightly during Spotless Checks by teachers. Sparkling Classroom Awards are awarded to winning classes, which have the highest number of stars and I.C.C.I points.
