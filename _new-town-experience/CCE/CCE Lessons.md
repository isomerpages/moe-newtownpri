<h3><strong>CCE Lessons</strong></h3>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core
values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense
of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in
the six curriculum content areas of CCE - National Education (NE), Sexuality
Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG),
Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE).</p>
