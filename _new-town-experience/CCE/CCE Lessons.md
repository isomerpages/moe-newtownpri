The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE - National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE).
