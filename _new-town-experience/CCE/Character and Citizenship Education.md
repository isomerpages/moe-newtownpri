<h3><strong>Character and Citizenship Education</strong></h3>
<p>At New Town Primary, we place students at the heart of all our efforts
in CCE, catering to their developmental needs, and their social-emotional
and mental well-being. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional
competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable
them to grow holistically and learn for life.</p>
<p><strong>The CCE Curriculum Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>The design of the school’s CCE curriculum, anchored on our school’s vision,
mission and values, also takes reference from MOE’s CCE2021 Curriculum
Framework as shown below.</p>

<p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core
values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense
of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in
the six curriculum content areas of CCE - National Education (NE), Sexuality
Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG),
Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE).</p>
