**Character and Citizenship Education**

At New Town Primary, we place students at the heart of all our efforts in CCE, catering to their developmental needs, and their social-emotional and mental well-being. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life.

**The CCE Curriculum Framework**

The design of the school’s CCE curriculum, anchored on our school’s vision, mission and values, also takes reference from MOE’s CCE2021 Curriculum Framework as shown below.

The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE - National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE).
