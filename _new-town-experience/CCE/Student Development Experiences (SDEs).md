**Student Development Experiences (SDEs)**

SDEs contribute towards the holistic development of our students in Cognitive, AestheticMoral, Physical and Social (CAMPS) domains. Key SDEs include:

* Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programmes 
* National Education (NE)
* Values in Action (VIA)

**National Education @ New Town**

National Education (NE) was launched in 1997 with the intent to instill national identity and the spirit of togetherness in our young. National Education (NE) comprises a wide range of school efforts that aims to:

* Provide our students with the knowledge, skills and values to understand Singapore's history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation's future.
* Be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making, to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.
* Help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans and foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which motivates our students to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.

The learning outcomes of NE are as follows:

**A Sense of Belonging**

To develop a deeper understanding of who we are and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.

**A Sense of Reality**
 
To be aware of the contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.

**A Sense of Hope**

Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.

**The Will to Act**           

To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.

**NE Commemorative Days**
One of the key SDEs is the P5 NE Show. With the resumption of mass activities in 2022, our P5 New Towners had a wonderful time celebrating the nation’s birthday together as one.

There are 4 NE commemorative days linked to significant points in Singapore’s history. In New Town, we customise activities for our students so that they learn important lessons on how to contribute as an active citizen.

**Values in Action @ New Town**

Values in Action (VIA) aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed to engender student ownership and initiative. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

New Town’s VIA framework, which emphasises our school value Service with a Heart, helps New Towners understand how they can contribute to the community through school-driven and student-initiated community projects.
