<p><strong>National Education @ New Town</strong>
</p>
<p>National Education (NE) was launched in 1997 with the intent to instill
national identity and the spirit of togetherness in our young. National
Education (NE) comprises a wide range of school efforts that aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide our students with the knowledge, skills and values to understand
Singapore's history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, appreciate
our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation,
and have confidence in our nation's future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making,
to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical
thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans
and foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which motivates
our students to play a contributory role in their immediate communities
and in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning outcomes of NE are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop a deeper understanding of who we are and a shared understanding
of the values that are important to us as a nation.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality</strong>
</p>
<p>To be aware of the contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints
and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of
a less predictable world.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope</strong>
</p>
<p>Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience
to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<p><strong>The Will to Act</strong>
</p>
<p>To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared
mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p>
<p><strong>NE Commemorative Days</strong> One of the key SDEs is the P5 NE
Show. With the resumption of mass activities in 2022, our P5 New Towners
had a wonderful time celebrating the nation’s birthday together as one.</p>

<p>There are 4 NE commemorative days linked to significant points in Singapore’s
history. In New Town, we customise activities for our students so that
they learn important lessons on how to contribute as an active citizen.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action @ New Town</strong>
</p>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who
contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application
of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed to engender student ownership
and initiative. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the
values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute
meaningfully.</p>
<p>New Town’s VIA framework, which emphasises our school value Service with
a Heart, helps New Towners understand how they can contribute to the community
through school-driven and student-initiated community projects.</p>
