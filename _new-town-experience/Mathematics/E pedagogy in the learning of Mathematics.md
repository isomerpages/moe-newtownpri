<p><strong>E-pedagogy in the learning of Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>At our school, we believe that every child can enjoy and succeed in mathematics
when learning is made meaningful, engaging, and accessible. Through the
use of e-pedagogy, we harness technology to bring abstract concepts to
life and create interactive learning experiences for our pupils. Platforms
such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) provide guided practice and visualisations
that help pupils build strong understanding of key concepts. Blooket introduces
fun and excitement by turning problem-solving into games, while ClassPoint
and Snorkl enables teachers to check understanding instantly and provide
immediate support during lessons. These tools also allow pupils to learn
at their own pace, revisit topics when needed, and receive timely feedback
to strengthen their confidence. By blending technology with effective teaching
practices, we nurture curiosity, resilience, and a love for mathematics
that will support our pupils in their learning journey.</p>
