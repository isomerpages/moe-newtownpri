**E-pedagogy in the learning of Mathematics**

At our school, we believe that every child can enjoy and succeed in mathematics when learning is made meaningful, engaging, and accessible. Through the use of e-pedagogy, we harness technology to bring abstract concepts to life and create interactive learning experiences for our pupils. Platforms such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) provide guided practice and visualisations that help pupils build strong understanding of key concepts. Blooket introduces fun and excitement by turning problem-solving into games, while ClassPoint and Snorkl enables teachers to check understanding instantly and provide immediate support during lessons. These tools also allow pupils to learn at their own pace, revisit topics when needed, and receive timely feedback to strengthen their confidence. By blending technology with effective teaching practices, we nurture curiosity, resilience, and a love for mathematics that will support our pupils in their learning journey.
