**Learning Support Mathematics (LSM) (P1 to P4)**

Learning Support Mathematics aims to provide early intervention support in Mathematics to students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills. In small groups, LSM trained teachers help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age and equip them with the mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions through learning experiences.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics (P4 to P5)**

The E2K Mathematics Programme is an enrichment for selected P4 and P5 students. It aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme. Through the rich learning experiences offered by the programme, students will develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess. They will also gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.
