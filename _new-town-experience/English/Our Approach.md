<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>At New Town Primary, we follow the MOE English Language Syllabus 2020.
The aim is to help every child build a strong foundation in English, enjoy
the language, and use it confidently in everyday life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this means for your child:&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Strong basics first – In the early years, we focus on reading, writing,
speaking and listening skills. Phonics, vocabulary and grammar are taught
in meaningful ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Step-by-step growth – Teachers provide guidance at the start and gradually
encourage children to take more responsibility for their own learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Learning with purpose – English is taught through real-life tasks, stories,
conversations and digital media so children see the relevance of what they
learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Reading for life – We nurture a love for reading, giving students time
and opportunities to read widely for both learning and enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>* All-round skills – Beyond reading and writing, children also learn to
speak clearly, listen actively, and use English in different forms such
as visuals, videos and presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Confidence and creativity – Students are encouraged to share their ideas,
think critically, and express themselves in different ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Support for every learner – Lessons are tailored to meet different learning
needs, ensuring each child is supported to progress at their own pace.&nbsp;</p>
