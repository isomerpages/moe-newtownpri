<p>The learning of English is most effective when it takes place through <strong>authentic and meaningful experiences.</strong> During
our <strong>Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE)</strong>, students step out
of the classroom and engage in hands-on activities that bring language
learning to life. These real-world contexts provide rich opportunities
for them to practice targeted language skills in fun and purposeful ways.&nbsp;</p>
