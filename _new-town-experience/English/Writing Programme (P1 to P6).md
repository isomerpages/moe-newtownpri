<p>Students at New Town Primary learn to create a wide variety of texts to
communicate meaning clearly and effectively. They write <strong>procedural texts</strong> such
as recipes and instructions, craft <strong>letters for different audiences</strong>,
and develop <strong>narratives</strong> to express ideas and stories. They
also learn to design <strong>visual texts</strong>, such as digital posters,
to communicate messages creatively. To nurture creativity and confidence,
we encourage <strong>freewriting</strong> activities like journals and quick
writes, giving students the freedom to use English spontaneously and with
enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>
