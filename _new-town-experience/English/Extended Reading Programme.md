<p>At New Town Primary, we believe that reading should be both meaningful
and fun. Our <strong>Extended Reading Programme</strong> gives students many
opportunities to explore the joy of books beyond the classroom. Every alternate
Tuesday, students enjoy <strong>Story Tuesday</strong> before the flag-raising
ceremony, Our library is also alive with engaging <strong>reading activities</strong> that
encourage students to explore different genres. Our lower primary learners
(P1–P3) dive into digital stories through <strong>Raz Kids Plus</strong>,
and our upper primary students (P4–P6) sharpen their awareness of the world
around them with the <strong>Little Red Dot</strong> newspaper. A highlight
of the year is our <strong>Reading Week</strong>, where the entire school
celebrates with a full week of activities — from book quizzes and storytelling
to dressing up as favourite book characters. Together, these experiences
nurture a love for reading and inspire our students to become lifelong
learners.&nbsp;</p>
