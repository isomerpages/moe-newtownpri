<p>The STELLAR vision: Children who love reading and have a strong foundation
in the English Language.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STELLAR</strong> aims to strengthen children’s language and reading
skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational
years. The programme uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate
materials to engage children in the learning of English. At lower primary,
language skills are developed through Shared Book Approach, modified Learning
Experiential activity and Focused Differentiated lessons. As students progress
to upper primary, language skills are further developed through KWL, Supported
Reading and Writing Process Cycle.&nbsp;</p>
