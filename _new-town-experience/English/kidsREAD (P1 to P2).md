<p>Held once a week on Wednesday afternoons, <strong>kidsREAD</strong> is supported
by student volunteers from secondary schools. In collaboration with the
National Library Board (NLB), the programme nurtures a love for reading
in our P1 and P2 students, helping them discover the joy of stories from
an early age.&nbsp;</p>
