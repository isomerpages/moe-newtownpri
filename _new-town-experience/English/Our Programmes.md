<p><strong>Extended Reading Programme&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>At New Town Primary, we believe that reading should be both meaningful
and fun. Our <strong>Extended Reading Programme</strong> gives students many
opportunities to explore the joy of books beyond the classroom. Every alternate
Tuesday, students enjoy <strong>Story Tuesday</strong> before the flag-raising
ceremony, Our library is also alive with engaging <strong>reading activities</strong> that
encourage students to explore different genres. Our lower primary learners
(P1–P3) dive into digital stories through <strong>Raz Kids Plus</strong>,
and our upper primary students (P4–P6) sharpen their awareness of the world
around them with the <strong>Little Red Dot</strong> newspaper. A highlight
of the year is our <strong>Reading Week</strong>, where the entire school
celebrates with a full week of activities — from book quizzes and storytelling
to dressing up as favourite book characters. Together, these experiences
nurture a love for reading and inspire our students to become lifelong
learners.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Writing Programme (P1 to P6)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Students at New Town Primary learn to create a wide variety of texts to
communicate meaning clearly and effectively. They write <strong>procedural texts</strong> such
as recipes and instructions, craft <strong>letters for different audiences</strong>,
and develop <strong>narratives</strong> to express ideas and stories. They
also learn to design <strong>visual texts</strong>, such as digital posters,
to communicate messages creatively. To nurture creativity and confidence,
we encourage <strong>freewriting</strong> activities like journals and quick
writes, giving students the freedom to use English spontaneously and with
enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reading Circles (P4 to P5)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Reading Circles give high-progress learners the chance to enjoy literature
more deeply. Through guided discussions, they explore interesting stories,
notice how good writers use language, and reflect on the values and themes
within the texts. This not only sharpens their language skills but also
nurtures a love for reading and thoughtful conversations.&nbsp;</p>
