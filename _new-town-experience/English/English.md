**Department Goals**
* To provide opportunities that allow students to engage in active listening, reading and viewing to enrich the language learning experience.
* To provide experiences that allow students to communicate effectively through speaking, writing and representing to promote confidence in using the English language.

**Learning Support Programme (LSP) (P1 to P2)**

A MOE intervention programme conducted by trained teachers to help selected P1 and P2 students. Lessons are carried out half an hour a day, in groups of up to 10 students a class. It is focused on building English language skills. 

**kidsREAD (P1 to P2)**

It is held once a week on Wednesday afternoons with the help of parent volunteers. The school collaborates with National Library Board (NLB) to promote the love for reading in our P1 and P2 students in New Town.

**S.T.A.R. Reading (Students and Teachers, All Reading - Whole School Approach to Reading) (P1 to P6)**

In New Town, we believe in cultivating a culture of reading among teachers and students. Through explicit teacher modelling and engaging students in a world of books, we aim to help them find the joy of reading.

**STELLAR (P1 to P6)**

The STELLAR vision: Children who love reading and have a strong foundation in the English Language.

STELLAR aims to strengthen childrenâ€™s language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational years. The programme uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage children in the learning of English. At lower primary, language skills are developed through Shared Book Approach, modified Learning Experiential activity and Focused Differentiated lessons. As students progress to upper primary, language skills are further developed through KWL, Supported Reading and Writing Process Cycle. 

**Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) (P1 to P4)**

The learning of English Language is best done through tasks and activities in authentic and meaningful contexts. In OLE, students engage in hands-on activities to further develop the targeted language features. 

**Writing Programme (P1 to P6)**

Students learn to create a variety of texts to convey meaning and purpose. From creating procedural texts such as recipes and instructions to writing letters to various audience and narrative writing, our students will learn how to express themselves in different contexts so as to bring the intended meaning across. We also encourage freewriting such as journals and quick write in class to allow students to use the language spontaneously. 

**Reading Circles (P4 to P5)**

To stretch our high progress learners, students are taught to appreciate literature texts, analyse good language use and explore values and themes.

**School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) (P3 to P4)**

This programme helps students with dyslexia learn more effectively,  and overcome literacy difficulties such as reading, spelling and comprehension.

**Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) (P3 to P4)**

RRP provides support for our P3 and P4 students who face difficulty in reading and comprehension. The programme teaches them a range of coping and learning strategies to help them manage their learning better in class.
