<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>To provide opportunities that allow students to engage in active listening,
reading and viewing to enrich the language learning experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide experiences that allow students to communicate effectively
through speaking, writing and representing to promote confidence in using
the English language.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>At New Town Primary, we follow the MOE English Language Syllabus 2020.
The aim is to help every child build a strong foundation in English, enjoy
the language, and use it confidently in everyday life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this means for your child:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strong basics first</strong> – In the early years, we focus on
reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. Phonics, vocabulary and
grammar are taught in meaningful ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step growth</strong> – Teachers provide guidance at the
start and gradually encourage children to take more responsibility for
their own learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning with purpose</strong> – English is taught through real-life
tasks, stories, conversations and digital media so children see the relevance
of what they learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reading for life</strong> – We nurture a love for reading, giving
students time and opportunities to read widely for both learning and enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>All-round skills</strong> – Beyond reading and writing, children
also learn to speak clearly, listen actively, and use English in different
forms such as visuals, videos and presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Confidence and creativity</strong> – Students are encouraged to
share their ideas, think critically, and express themselves in different
ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Support for every learner</strong> – Lessons are tailored to meet
different learning needs, ensuring each child is supported to progress
at their own pace.&nbsp;</p>
